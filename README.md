# CYCLOPS
The UI/UX Pattern Guide for the CenturyLink Platform. View the latest version of Cyclops here: http://assets.ctl.io/

## Get Started
Include the built cyclops javaScript and CSS files as well as the dependencies listed below. Add `.cyclops` to the `html` tag to properly scope the styles. This allows Cyclops to override any existing styles that have been defined by legacy markup. Documentation for cyclops can be viewed by running the development server `gulp dev`


## Developing Cyclops

```
npm install coffee-script -g
npm install
gulp dev
```

## Creating a Release/Build
Releases are placed in the `dist` folder at the root of the project inside of a version number folder. The version number is pulled from `package.json`
```
gulp dist
```
