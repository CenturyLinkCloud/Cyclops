        <h4>Where can I get it?</h4>
        <p>
          It is recommended that you use the CDN version of Cyclops that is hosted on
          <a href="assets.ctl.io">assets.ctl.io</a>. This provides many caching and performance
          benefits. If you would like to view of the source if can be found on

        <h4>What browsers does it support?</h4>
        <p>
          The browser support matrix for Cyclops matches that of the CenturyLink Control
          Portal. We support the current versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. For Internet
          Explorer we support IE9 and above with IE9 having some fall back behaviors.

      <section id="versions" class="qa">
        <h4>How can I get notified about new versions / features?</h4>
        <p>
        All publically available version of Cyclops can be found on the
        <a href="assets.ctl.io">assets.ctl.io</a> website and as tags on the github repository.
        This includes both stable and prerelease versions, which can be identified using the
        <a href="symver.org">semantic versioning syntax</a>. As a general rule of thumb new stable
        versions will be called out in our slack channel as well. If you have a feature request
        please open and issue on the Cyclops github repository.

      <section id="angular" class="qa">
        <h4>Can I use it with Angular?</h4>
        <p>
          Cyclops is built on the standard set of CenturyLink Control Portal Frameworks,
          which include jQuery, jQuery UI, Knockout, and Knockout Validation. Because of this
          Cyclops provides many of its controls and helper as knockout related features or
          extensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cyclops can currently be used in conjunction with Angular in one of two ways. One,
          you can use the styles and markup provided and use Angular for everything
          else. Two, you can use Angular for the routing and controller bits and use knockout
          for the markup binding and templating.
